# 📊 December OEE Performance Overview  
**Manufacturing Operations Dashboard Analysis**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **December Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) analysis** across multiple manufacturing plants and production lines. The objective is to evaluate equipment performance, identify efficiency losses, and support data-driven operational decisions.

The dashboard compares:
- Abuja Steel Mill (ASML)
- African Steel Mill (ASM)
- African Foundries (AFL) – Line A
- African Foundries (AFL) – Line B

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure and compare **OEE performance** across plants and production lines  
- Identify key drivers of efficiency losses (Availability, Performance, Quality)  
- Compare **actual production vs target production**  
- Support operational decision-making with clear visual insights  

---

## 🧮 Key Metrics Used
- **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**
- **Availability (%)**
- **Performance (%)**
- **Quality (%)**
- **Downtime (%)**
- **Mill Utilisation (%)**
- **Net Available Time**
- **Actual Production vs Target Production**

**OEE Formula:**


OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality



---

## 📈 Dashboard Description
The dashboard provides a consolidated view of manufacturing performance using:
- Gauge charts to display OEE and its components
- Bar charts for downtime, mill utilisation, and production
- Side-by-side comparison of plants and production lines

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 🏭 Abuja Steel Mill (ASML)
- **OEE:** 75.37% (Highest among all sites)
- **Strength:** Strong performance rate (above standard)
- **Challenge:** High downtime (25.6%)
- **Insight:** Reducing downtime could significantly improve output

---

### 🏭 African Steel Mill (ASM)
- **OEE:** 70.07%
- **Strength:** High quality output (100%)
- **Challenge:** Performance efficiency losses
- **Insight:** Performance optimisation is the primary improvement opportunity

---

### 🏭 African Foundries – Line A
- **OEE:** 60.48% (Lowest)
- **Strength:** Very high quality (99.7%)
- **Challenge:** Low performance efficiency
- **Insight:** Speed and process inefficiencies are impacting output

---

### 🏭 African Foundries – Line B
- **OEE:** 63.76%
- **Strength:** Better performance compared to Line A
- **Challenge:** Availability and downtime losses
- **Insight:** Improved maintenance planning could increase availability

---

## 📊 Overall Findings
- Quality levels remain consistently high across all plants
- Performance losses are the **major contributor to reduced OEE**
- Downtime reduction offers the **largest opportunity for improvement**
- ASML demonstrates best overall performance but still has downtime risks

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data analysis and dashboard design)
- OEE and Manufacturing KPI frameworks
